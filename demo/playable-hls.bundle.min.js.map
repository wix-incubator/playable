It can be requested and called for single execution\n * using the `tick` method.\n *\n * It will be assured that the task execution method (`tick`) only gets called once per main loop \"tick\",\n * no matter how often it gets requested for execution. Execution in further ticks will be scheduled accordingly.\n *\n * If further execution requests have already been scheduled on the next tick, it can be checked with `hasNextTick`,\n * and cancelled with `clearNextTick`.\n *\n * The task can be scheduled as an interval repeatedly with a period as parameter (see `setInterval`, `clearInterval`).\n *\n * Sub-classes need to implement the `doTick` method which will effectively have the task execution routine.\n *\n * Further explanations:\n *\n * The baseclass has a `tick` method that will schedule the doTick call. It may be called synchroneously\n * only for a stack-depth of one. On re-entrant calls, sub-sequent calls are scheduled for next main loop ticks.\n *\n * When the task execution (`tick` method) is called in re-entrant way this is detected and\n * we are limiting the task execution per call stack to exactly one, but scheduling/post-poning further\n * task processing on the next main loop iteration (also known as \"next tick\" in the Node/JS runtime lingo).\n */\n\nvar TaskLoop = function (_EventHandler) {\n  task_loop__inherits(TaskLoop, _EventHandler);\n\n  function TaskLoop(hls) {\n    task_loop__classCallCheck(this, TaskLoop);\n\n    for (var _len = arguments.length, events = Array(_len > 1 ?
